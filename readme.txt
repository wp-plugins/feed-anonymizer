Here is a short description of the plugin.  This should be no more than 150 characters.  No markup here.

== Description ==

Replaces individual author names in feeds with the site name.

This is useful for blogs that are written by multiple authors that have the "authoritative voice" of the blog itself,
rather than attributing each post to its individual author.  This plugin makes the posts in the feeds (all feeds: rss,
rss2, atom, rdf, etc) appear to be written anonymously, instead using the name of the site as the publishing author,
rather than the name of the author.  This prevents admins from having to edit core files to make posts in the feed anonymous.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `feedanonymizer.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
